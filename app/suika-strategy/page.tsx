              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Advanced Placement Strategies</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The foundation of Suika Game mastery lies in understanding optimal fruit placement. Always start by
                building stable foundations along the bottom edges of the container. This creates a solid base for
                larger fruits and prevents unstable stacking that can lead to container overflow and game over
                situations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Focus on corner placement for your largest fruits, as corners provide maximum stability and support. Use
                the container walls strategically to guide fruit positioning and create predictable bounce patterns that
                work in your favor rather than against your planning.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Chain Reaction Techniques</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Advanced Suika Game players focus on creating chain reactions - sequences of merges that happen
                automatically after a single strategic fruit drop. Plan your moves to set up multiple identical fruits
                in close proximity, then trigger the chain with precise placement that maximizes the cascading effect.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The key to successful chain reactions is patience and spatial awareness. Don't rush to merge fruits
                immediately; instead, build up clusters of identical fruits that can create cascading merge sequences
                when the right opportunity presents itself.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Space Management Mastery</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Efficient space management separates good players from Suika Game experts. Always consider the physics
                of how fruits will settle after dropping. Leave strategic gaps that can accommodate natural rolling and
                bouncing behavior while maintaining overall container organization.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Monitor your container's fill level constantly and prioritize creating merges in the most congested
                areas to free up room for continued gameplay. Develop an eye for identifying which areas of the
                container are becoming problematic before they cause game-ending overflow.
